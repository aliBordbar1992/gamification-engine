## Phase 2 – Event System

### Store events in DB with retention policy ✅
**Completed:** 2025-01-26

- **DbContext Configuration**: Configured `GamificationEngineDbContext` with proper entity mappings for `Event` and `UserState` entities
- **JSONB Support**: Implemented JSON serialization for complex properties like `Attributes`, `PointsByCategory`, `Badges`, and `Trophies` using PostgreSQL's JSONB column type
- **Repository Implementations**: Created EF Core implementations of `IEventRepository` and `IUserStateRepository` with full CRUD operations
- **Retention Policy Service**: Implemented `EventRetentionService` as a background service to automatically clean up old events based on configurable retention periods
- **Database Indexes**: Added performance indexes on `UserId`, `EventType`, `OccurredAt`, and composite index on `UserId + EventType`
- **Service Registration**: Provided extension methods for easy DI container setup and health checks
- **Migration Support**: Added `DesignTimeDbContextFactory` for EF Core migrations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Created dedicated test project with 13 passing tests covering DbContext configuration, entity mapping, and repository functionality
- **DDD Compliance**: Maintained domain model purity while enabling persistence through proper EF Core configuration

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/Infrastructure/Storage.EntityFramework/` (new project)
- `tests/Infrastructure.EntityFramework.Tests/` (new test project)

**Technical Details:**
- Uses EF Core 9.0.4 with Npgsql PostgreSQL driver
- Implements JSONB columns for flexible attribute storage
- Supports configurable event retention policies
