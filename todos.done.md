## Phase 1 – Project Foundations (Completed)

- [x] Set up repository structure (solution + modular projects: Domain, Application, Infrastructure.Configuration, Infrastructure.Storage.InMemory, Shared, Tests)
  - Matches `todos.md` Phase 1 item: repository structure
- [x] Decide on language, framework, and package management
  - .NET 9 (C#), xUnit + Shouldly, NuGet; aligns with project rules
- [x] Implement configuration loader (YAML parser with validation)
  - Added `YamlConfigurationLoader` and `ConfigurationValidator`; tests load `configuration-example.yml`
- [x] Define domain model base classes: Event, Condition, Reward, Rule, UserState
  - Minimal invariants and encapsulation as per Clean Architecture
- [x] Add pluggable storage interface (UserState repository) and in-memory adapter
  - `IUserStateRepository` and `UserStateRepository` (in-memory) with tests
- [x] Create base test harness with automated test runner
  - Solution-wide test projects running green with Shouldly
- [x] Document coding conventions and contribution guidelines
  - Added `CODING-STANDARDS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Deliverable achieved: Barebones project loads config, passes validation, and runs tests successfully.

## Phase 2 – Event System (Partially Completed)

- [x] Implement Event class with metadata and attributes
  - Matches `todos.md` Phase 2 item: Event class implementation
  - Event class already existed with proper validation, immutable properties, and ReadOnlyDictionary for attributes
  - Follows Clean Architecture principles with no external dependencies
- [x] Add event ingestion API (REST endpoint: `POST /events`)
  - Matches `todos.md` Phase 2 item: event ingestion API
  - Created `GamificationEngine.Api` project with proper project references
  - Implemented `IEventIngestionService` and `EventIngestionService` in Application layer
  - Created `IEventRepository` interface in Domain layer
  - Implemented `EventRepository` (in-memory) in Infrastructure layer
  - Added `EventsController` with POST `/api/events` endpoint
  - Added additional endpoints: GET `/api/events/user/{userId}` and GET `/api/events/type/{eventType}`
  - Configured dependency injection in Program.cs
  - API successfully tested with event ingestion and retrieval
  - All tests passing, build successful

Deliverable achieved: Events can be sent to the engine via POST /api/events and retrieved via API endpoints.

- [x] Support event queue (in-memory first, later pluggable for Kafka/RabbitMQ/etc.)
  - Matches `todos.md` Phase 2 item: event queue implementation
  - **Following TDD principles**: Created comprehensive test suite BEFORE implementation
  - Created `IEventQueue` interface in Application.Abstractions layer
  - Created `IEventQueueProcessor` interface for background processing
  - Implemented `InMemoryEventQueue` using ConcurrentQueue for thread safety
  - Implemented `EventQueueProcessor` with proper async processing and cancellation
  - Updated `EventIngestionService` to use queue instead of direct storage
  - Added proper dependency injection configuration
  - **Test Coverage**: 15 tests total (4 existing + 11 new)
    - `EventQueueTests`: 5 tests covering queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, size, empty)
    - `EventQueueProcessorTests`: 8 tests covering processor lifecycle and error handling
    - `EventIngestionServiceTests`: 2 tests covering service integration with queue
  - **Architecture Benefits**:
    - Clean Architecture compliance with interfaces in Application layer
    - Asynchronous event processing improving API response times
    - Thread-safe implementation using ConcurrentQueue and SemaphoreSlim
    - Easy extensibility for future Kafka/RabbitMQ implementations
    - Proper error handling and logging throughout the pipeline
  - **All tests passing**: 15/15 tests successful
  - **Build successful**: All projects compile without errors
  - **Migrated to Background Services**: 
    - Replaced `EventQueueProcessor` with `EventQueueBackgroundService` using ASP.NET Core Hosted Services
    - Updated Program.cs to use `AddHostedService<EventQueueBackgroundService>()`
    - Removed old `IEventQueueProcessor` interface and implementation
    - Updated tests to use new background service architecture
    - **All tests passing**: 31/31 tests successful after migration
    - **Clean Architecture maintained**: Background service properly integrated with dependency injection
