## Phase 1 â€“ Project Foundations (Completed)

- [x] Set up repository structure (solution + modular projects: Domain, Application, Infrastructure.Configuration, Infrastructure.Storage.InMemory, Shared, Tests)
  - Matches `todos.md` Phase 1 item: repository structure
- [x] Decide on language, framework, and package management
  - .NET 9 (C#), xUnit + Shouldly, NuGet; aligns with project rules
- [x] Implement configuration loader (YAML parser with validation)
  - Added `YamlConfigurationLoader` and `ConfigurationValidator`; tests load `configuration-example.yml`
- [x] Define domain model base classes: Event, Condition, Reward, Rule, UserState
  - Minimal invariants and encapsulation as per Clean Architecture
- [x] Add pluggable storage interface (UserState repository) and in-memory adapter
  - `IUserStateRepository` and `UserStateRepository` (in-memory) with tests
- [x] Create base test harness with automated test runner
  - Solution-wide test projects running green with Shouldly
- [x] Document coding conventions and contribution guidelines
  - Added `CODING-STANDARDS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Deliverable achieved: Barebones project loads config, passes validation, and runs tests successfully.
